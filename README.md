# Unicode-Tools

*A Unicode library to support font creation software.*

A JavaScript library to work with Unicode data. Yet explorative and maybe never really useful. The aim is to gather a better understanding of how *a unicode library to support font creation software* should look like.

I will initially base some really simple tools on this.

At the moment this parses the UCD on loadtime, so this is rather slow loading. Preloading and compression techniques will be considered later.

Look at https://github.com/devongovett/unicode-properties for an interesting and more complete unicode library. More Tips are welcome.
